# BrainstormScripts
Brainstorm is a two-player cooperative 3D platformer that teaches neuroscience and brain concepts. This game was developed on Unity for the [COMP350 - Computational Media: Videogame Design and Development](https://iasext.wesleyan.edu/regprod/!wesmaps_page.html?crse=014490&term=1181) course taught by [Professor Christopher Weaver](http://www.wesleyan.edu/academics/faculty/cweaver/profile.html) at [Wesleyan University](http://www.wesleyan.edu). Here are links to the [gameplay trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8_6j7DDoUs), [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3r3AOiiue4), and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/brainstormgooeygames/). 

The most recent build for those interested in playing can be sent by request. Source project files can be viewed by request as well.

This repository contains scripts written in C# made for ensuring functionality to different aspects of the game such as the camera, player, UI, enemies, etc.

# BrainstormScripts

### Brainstorm is a two-player cooperative platformer that aims to teach nueroscience and brain concepts to 5th graders.
### This game was developed on Unity for the COMP350 - Videogame Design and Development course taught by Professor Christopher Weaver at Wesleyan University.

### In this repository are scripts made for ensuring functionality to different aspects of the game such as the camera, player, UI, enemies, etc.

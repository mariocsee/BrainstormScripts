# BrainstormScripts

Brainstorm is a two-player cooperative platformer that aims to teach nueroscience and brain concepts to 5th graders. This game was developed on Unity for the [COMP350 - Computational Media: Videogame Design and Development](https://iasext.wesleyan.edu/regprod/!wesmaps_page.html?crse=014490&term=1181) course taught by [Professor Christopher Weaver](http://www.wesleyan.edu/academics/faculty/cweaver/profile.html) at [Wesleyan University](http://www.wesleyan.edu).

In this repository are scripts made for ensuring functionality to different aspects of the game such as the camera, player, UI, enemies, etc.
